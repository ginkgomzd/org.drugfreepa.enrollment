    Defines and automates the workflows surrounding the Drug Free
    Workplace Membership Enrollment Process. When a member enrolls with Drug
    Free Workplace Solutions, a series of tasks are set in motion to fulfill
    the membership, including the sending of welcome packets, the surveying
    of enrollees to gather information for creating the Drug Free Workplace
    Policy, and a series of other reminders.
